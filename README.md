An image uploader. Written in PHP, supports popular formats: png, jpeg, gif, webp.

Lets you upload multiple images in a row and see them all in one view. Generates a permalink and lets you copy it right away. No bullshit steps along the way.

Uploaded image is verified and re-created from its contents to provide some layer of security against exploits.

## Deps

[PHP](https://www.php.net/) | [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) | [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) | [Imagecraft](https://github.com/coldume/imagecraft) | [KEYS.css by Michael HÃ¼neburg](https://github.com/michaelhue/keyscss)

## Installation methods

### Standalone

##### Requirements

* PHP
  * Enable modules: `ctype`, `exif`, `fileinfo`, `gd`, `iconv`, `mbstring`, `openssl` and `phar`.
  * Increase the `upload_max_filesize` and  `post_max_size` to `10M`
* Nginx: increase [client_max_body_size](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size) to `10M`
* HTTP Server or PHP-FPM must have write access to the `i` and `logs`.

##### Installation

1. [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and update its dependencies: `php composer.phar update`.
2. Disallow access to dot files, logs and other unnecessary files in the web server configuration.
3. Edit config.php, replace `allowed_hosts` with your domain and adjust the settings to your needs.
4. Edit manifest.json and change `start_url` for PWA.

##### Quick setup

```
git clone https://github.com/c0m4r/up.git
cd up
wget https://getcomposer.org/download/2.7.9/composer.phar
echo "b6de5e65c199d80ba11897fbe1364e063e858d483f6a81a176c4d60f2b1d6347 composer.phar" | sha256sum -c || rm composer.phar
php composer.phar update
```

### Docker

This setup is based on [joseluisq/alpine-php-fpm](https://github.com/joseluisq/alpine-php-fpm)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c0m4r/up.git
cd up
wget https://getcomposer.org/download/2.7.9/composer.phar
echo "b6de5e65c199d80ba11897fbe1364e063e858d483f6a81a176c4d60f2b1d6347 composer.phar" | sha256sum -c || rm composer.phar
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec php-fpm /bin/sh -c "cd /usr/share/nginx/html && php composer.phar update"
chown -R 82:82 i logs
```

Change uid:gid depending on your setup so the PHP-FPM have write access to the `i` and `logs`.

```bash
echo $(curl http://localhost:8080 &> /dev/null && ps -eo pid,uid,gid,command,cgroup | grep docke[r] | grep "php-fpm: pool www" | awk '{print $2":"$3}')
```
